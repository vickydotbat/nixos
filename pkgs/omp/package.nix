# Packages the prebuilt `omp` (oh-my-pi) release binary.
#
# omp ships as a Bun single-file executable: a host runtime with the bundled
# JS/TS, embedded `.node` native addons and the Rust core all appended to the
# end of the file. Bun locates that payload by seeking from EOF of its own
# executable, so the binary must NOT be modified — `strip` and `patchelf` both
# rewrite the ELF and shift/clobber the trailer, breaking startup. We therefore
# install the binary verbatim and, on Linux, run it through the Nix dynamic
# loader at launch instead of patching its interpreter.
#
# Building from source is deliberately avoided: omp is a Bun+Rust workspace with
# per-release codegen (see upstream), which is fragile to reproduce in Nix. Bump
# with `./update.sh` (rewrites VERSION.json from the GitHub release API).
